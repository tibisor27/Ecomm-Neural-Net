### 🎯 **Core Technical Competencies**
✅ **End-to-End Neural Network Implementation**  
- Built with **PyTorch** from scratch (no high-level wrappers)  
- Custom architecture: `Linear(8) → ReLU() → Sigmoid()` with BCELoss  
- Batch training via `DataLoader` with shuffle  

✅ **Production-Ready Data Pipeline**  
- Professional missing value handling:  
- Scalable preprocessing: MinMax scaling + one-hot encoding

✅ **Production-Ready Data Pipeline**  
- Modular structure, reproducibility, scalability
- Type consistency enforcement
- Clean separation of preprocessing/modeling code

### 🎯 What Sets This Apart from Academic Projects
- Real-World Data Challenges Solved
- Mixed data types (numeric, categorical, temporal)
- Custom business rules for missing values
- Production-style feature engineering
- Professional Practices Demonstrated

### 📜 Certification

This project was developed as the final capstone of the AI Associate for Data Science career track on DataCamp.
Upon successful completion, I was awarded the official:

> 🏅 AI Associate for Data Science Certification
> Issued by DataCamp, 2025

It demonstrates hands-on ability to apply AI techniques, build production-grade machine learning pipelines, and work with real-world customer behavior data.
